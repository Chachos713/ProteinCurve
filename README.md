# ProteinCurve
A proof of concept program to compute of the curvature of a protein.

This program computes the curvature of a protein at a given point.
It was a proof of concept to find a more accurate algorithm, that still runs fast.

Note: You need to download Jama-1.0.3.jar and vecmath.jar to compile and run.

Answers the question:
What is the radius of the largest sphere that contains a point (p) but does not enter a protein.
